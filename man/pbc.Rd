\description{
Data from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the
liver. This dataset was obtained from the \strong{survival} package:
the variables \code{copper} and \code{trig} from \code{survival::pbc} were
merged into \code{survival::pbcseq} and several categorical variables were
re-coded.
