\description{
This data was simulated to mimic data from a longitudinal cohort study
following mothers and their child from birth until approximately 4 years of
age.
It contains 2400 observations of 200 mother-child pairs. Children's BMI and
head circumference was measured repeatedly and their age in months was
recorded at each measurement. Furthermore, the data contain several baseline
variables with information on the mothers' demographics and socio-economic
status.
