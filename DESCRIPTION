Version: 0.1.0
Title: Joint Analysis and Imputation of Incomplete Data
Author: Nicole S. Erler
Maintainer: Nicole S. Erler <n.erler@erasmusmc.nl>
Description: Joint imputation and analysis of linear regression models,
    generalized linear regression models or linear mixed models with incomplete
    (covariate) data in the Bayesian framework.
    The package performs some pre-processing of the data and creates a JAGS
    model, which will then automatically be passed to JAGS with the help of 
    the package rjags.
    It also provides summary and plotting functions for the output.
