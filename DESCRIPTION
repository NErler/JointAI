Description: Provides joint analysis and imputation of linear regression models,
    generalized linear regression models or linear mixed models with incomplete
    (covariate) data in the Bayesian framework.
    The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
    model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' 
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net> with the help of 
    the package 'rjags'.
    It also provides summary and plotting functions for the output.
