Description: Provides joint analysis and imputation of (generalized) 
    linear regression models, (generalized) linear mixed models and parametric
    survival models with incomplete (covariate) data in the Bayesian framework.
    The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
    model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' 
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net> with the help of 
    the package 'rjags'.
    It also provides summary and plotting functions for the output.
