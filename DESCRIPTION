Description: Provides joint analysis and imputation of (generalized) 
    linear and cumulative logit regression models, (generalized) linear and 
    cumulative logit mixed models and parametric (Weibull) as well as Cox
    proportional hazards survival models with incomplete (covariate) data in 
    the Bayesian framework.
    The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
    model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' 
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net> with the help of 
    the package 'rjags'.
    It also provides summary and plotting functions for the output and allows 
    to export imputed values.
