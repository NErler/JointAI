Description: Joint analysis and imputation of incomplete data in the Bayesian
    framework, using (generalized) linear (mixed) models and extensions there of,
    survival models, or joint models for longitudinal and survival data.
    Incomplete covariates, if present, are automatically imputed.
    The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
    model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' 
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/> with the help of 
    the package 'rjags'.
