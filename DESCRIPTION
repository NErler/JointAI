Description: The package facilitates a range of functions to perform analysis
    in the presence of incomplete data in the Bayesian framework.
    Available model types include (generalized) linear, log-normal, beta,
    cumulative logit and multinomial logit regression models as well as
    multi-level (mixed model) versions of these models.
    Moreover, parametric (Weibull) and proportional hazards survival models and
    joint models of longitudinal and survival data are implemented and it is
    possible to fit multiple models of mixed types simultaneously.
    Incomplete covariates, if present, are automatically imputed.
    The package performs some preprocessing of the data and creates a 'JAGS'
    model, which will then automatically be passed to 'JAGS' 
    <http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net> with the help of 
    the package 'rjags'.
