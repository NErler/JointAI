## Formula components
### Fixed effects

**linear effects**

* of baseline covariates
* of time-varying covariates
    - no missing values allowed
      <span style = "color:red">(=> should create an error message!)</span>
    - have to be observed together (at the same time points) with the outcome
      <span style = "color:red">(=> check and error message)</span>

    
    
**Interactions**

* 2-way interactions between baseline covariates (may contain missing values)
* 2-way interactions involving time-varying covariates
    - time-varying covariates have to be complete
* interactions with the time variable
  <span style = "color:red"> haven't thought about if this requires other
  restrictions than interaction with time-varying covariates</span>
* <span style = "color:blue"> interactions involving more than 2 variables???</span>


**non-linear effects**

* splines (using the `splines` package)
    - only completely observed variables
    - should be possible for baseline, time-varying covariates and the time variable
    - <span style = "color:red"> need to check the functionalities of the
      splines package, if there are other functions than `bs()` and `ns()` that
      should be considered</span>
* `log()`, `sqrt()`, `x^2`, `I()`


### Random effects


# Implemented and tested


## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.
